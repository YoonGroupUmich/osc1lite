Custom waveform is defined in .cwave file. The cwave file is a text file that contains the amplitude value of each sample, in uA (microamps). Each sample is in a separate row.

You can also generate the cwave file programmatically. The provided sine_wave.c and sine_wave.py will generate a sine.cwave, which is a 10ms 100uA sinusoidal waveform.
